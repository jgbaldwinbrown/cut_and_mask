# Cut and mask

Tools for cutting parts out of a genome

## Purpose of these tools

If a genome has, for example, portions that are found to be contaminated, these
tools can remove those portions of the genome from a fasta file, and can alter
gff and vcf files associated with that genome so that their coordinates match
the new version of the genome. This can be useful if you find out there are
contaminants late into the assembly of a genome.
